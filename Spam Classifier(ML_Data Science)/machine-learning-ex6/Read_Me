This machine learning program accepts an e-mail message which may be spam or non-spam
It uses Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and learns from a dictionary of possible spam words
I used filtering to filter out the recipients' address, common spam traps like numbers, symbols etc
This extracts the actual meaning of the e-mail
A sample spam/non-spam trains the algorithm
Algorithm is then for a completely new e-mail to classify it as either spam or non-spam
