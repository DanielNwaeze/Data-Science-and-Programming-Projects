This project deals with price prediction.
The first problem is thus:
"You will implement linear regression with one variable to predict proﬁts for a food truck.
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering diﬀerent cities for opening a new outlet.
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next."
I used linear regression with one variable to achieve the predictions for 35,000 and 70,000 populations.

The second problem is thus:
 "You will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses.
 Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be."
 The dataset for the house sizes, number of bedrooms and the house prices were given.
 I used feature normalisation for the sizes and bedrooms and predicted the price of a 1650 square feet house with 3 bedrooms.
 
 This is an assignment/project I completed from my machine learning course, Stanford University, Coursera.
