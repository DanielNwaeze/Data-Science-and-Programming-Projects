In this project, I implemented a machine learning algorithm for determining an applicant's probability of admission
The applicant wrote two examinations and applied to a university
Given the data of the previous year's admitted applicants' grades in these examinations, I evaluated the applicants' chances of admission
This was done with logistic regression.

In the second part of the project, I had the data of microchips passed through two tests and evaluated if they are accepted or not
I used logistic regression to determine if a given chip with given test details will be accepted.

The assignment/project was completed from my Andrew NG machine learnning course, Stanford University Coursera.
