The project is still a work in progress.
It is uploaded to give an idea of what I want to achieve.
It is a football manager 5-a-side game which I selected the players from the top football players in the world as of 2019.
I used user defined structs for forwards, midfielders, defenders and goalkeepers.
These structs stored the details, ages and ratings according to their positions.
For example, a forward would have a relevant rating on shooting and dribbling.
Defenders are expected to have relevant ratings in interception and tackling ability.
You get to select which player you want from the list to make the 5-a-side team.
You then play against your choice out of a possible 5 opposition teams which were selected from the same list of players.
Your players' abilities and ratings will be used to judge the outcome of the match.
The match details/commentary will also be provided where you get to see what really happened in the outcome of the match.
I am working on the match commentary details right now.
I have used several functions to represent the extraction of players' details as well as the opposition.
The names, ages and abilities of players were searched up for accurate player details.

I will update to know when I am done
