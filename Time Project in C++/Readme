The time measurement code simply evaluates the period between two given ‘start’ and ‘end’ times.
I utilized user defined struct TIME to store the hour, minute and second components of each time.
T1 represents the initial time
T2 represents the final time
Diff represents the difference in time/ time interval
I used:
void Difference (TIME t1, TIME t2, TIME *difference);
to compute the time interval and register its value to Diff
A do-while loop was used for the user to repeat the program for different times
